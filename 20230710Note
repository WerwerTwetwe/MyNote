终于稍微停顿了下来，过去很长一段时间为了追求想要追求的，奔波不停，稍有空余，便又进行了一下静静的思考，记录如下。
也只才过去了短短几年，过去那种为别人而转动不停，如行尸走肉一般活着的日子已经恍若隔世。
这个熙熙攘攘的世界，唯有金钱才能赎回本就属于自己的时间与精力。
当可以主宰自己的时间与精力时才算真正活过人间。
曾经不惜贱卖自己的一切去换得温饱……

After a period of relentless striving to pursue my goals, I finally had a moment to pause and reflect. Though only a few short years have passed, my previous life of endless toiling for others already seems a lifetime away.
In this busy world, only money can buy back the time and energy that inherently belong to oneself. One cannot be said to have truly lived until one gains mastery over one's own time and resources.
I once sold my dignity for mere survival... But now, things are different. The long nights are over, and a new dawn has come. At last, I live by my own compass, each day a step towards redeeming my time, my energy, my identity.
There is power in this reclamation. I move with purpose, no longerfrantic, but focused. Wiser for the years traded, yet open to new lessons. Gratitude fills me for this second chance to inhabit each moment.
The crowds jostle past, in their hurry and worry. But I have learned to walk to my own rhythm. Each minute measured carefully, not wasted. The present embraced fully, the future anticipated calmly.  
This newfound agency is hard-won. I do not take it for granted. Each small choice consecrates my autonomy. At the end of the road, I hope to look back with contentment, knowing every breath and footstep carried meaning. Until then, I walk on lightly. The journey is just beginning.
